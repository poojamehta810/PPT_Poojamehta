        "\n",
        "**a. K-fold cross-validation:** In k-fold cross-validation, the data is randomly divided into k subsets (or folds) of approximately equal size. Each fold is used as the validation set once while the remaining k-1 folds are used for training. This process is repeated k times, and the performance metrics are averaged.\n",
        "\n",
        "**b. Stratified k-fold cross-validation:** Stratified k-fold cross-validation is used when the target variable has imbalanced class distributions. It ensures that each fold has a representative distribution of the target classes. In other words, the class proportions in each fold are maintained close to the overall class proportions in the entire dataset. This is particularly useful when one class is significantly smaller than the others, preventing bias in the performance evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, k-fold cross-validation is random in its partitioning, while stratified k-fold cross-validation is mindful of class imbalances and ensures more consistent performance evaluation in such scenarios."
